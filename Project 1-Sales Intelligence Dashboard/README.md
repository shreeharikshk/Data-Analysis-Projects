## 🔍 Analysis

**Define**
The business had no structured view of which products, regions and customers were driving revenue - marketing and stock decisions were made without data-driven direction.

**Measure**
Electronics accounts for 50.3% of revenue - R287M of R571M total. The bottom 3 categories (Books, Health, Clothing) contribute less than 10% combined. Revenue grew consistently from R113M in 2021 to R115M in 2025.

**Analyze - Whys**
1. Revenue is concentrated in one category → Electronics dominates at 50%
2. Electronics dominates → high unit price products (Laptop R1,200, Desktop R1,500) drive disproportionate revenue
3. Other categories underperform → lower price points and lower purchase frequency
4. Lower purchase frequency → customers buy electronics once but consumables repeatedly
5. No repeat purchase strategy → no loyalty or upsell mechanism driving cross-category spend

**Root cause: Revenue concentration risk - single category dependency with no cross-sell strategy in place.**

**Improve**
Bundle low-performing categories with Electronics purchases. Introduce loyalty incentives for repeat buyers in Health and Sports. Target top 10 customers - averaging R560K spend - with exclusive offers to increase basket size.

**Control**
Monthly revenue dashboard review. Flag any month where Electronics drops below 45% of revenue - may indicate demand shift requiring stock reallocation. Track top customer spend quarterly.

## 📋 Recommendations

1. 🔴 **Reduce category concentration risk** - Electronics at 50% creates single-point revenue vulnerability
2. ⚠️ **Activate the International region** - leads revenue despite smallest customer base - high value segment underserved
3. ⚠️ **Build a December strategy** - seasonal spike is predictable, stock and campaign preparation should begin in October
4. 🟢 **Retain top 10 customers** - averaging R197K per customer, dedicated account management would protect this revenue

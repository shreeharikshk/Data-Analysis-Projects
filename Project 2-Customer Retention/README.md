# 📊 Project 2 - Customer Retention Analytics

**Industry:** E-Commerce
**Tools:** SQL Server · Power BI · Python · Star Schema Modelling
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

An e-commerce business operating across 5 countries had transaction data but no visibility into customer behaviour - who was returning, who was at risk of churning, and which segments drove lifetime value. This project analysed **500,000 orders** across **5,000 customers** over 5 years (2021-2025), delivering a dashboard that gave leadership actionable insight into retention, acquisition and revenue by segment.

## 🔍 Analysis

**Define**
The business could not identify which customers were churning, which segments to prioritise, or where retention investment would generate the highest return. Marketing spend was undirected.

**Measure**
At Risk segment CLV of R68,755 is virtually equal to the High Value segment at R68,777 - meaning the business is on the verge of losing its most valuable customers. Return rate is healthy at 4.99% but the At Risk segment size signals imminent revenue loss.

**Analyze - Whys**
1. Revenue at risk → At Risk segment nearly matches High Value CLV
2. At Risk segment is large → no retention mechanism targeting lapsing customers
3. No retention mechanism → business had no visibility into segment behaviour before this analysis
4. No visibility → transaction data existed but was never structured for behavioural analysis
5. Data not structured → no dimensional model connecting orders to customer segments over time

**Root cause: Absence of customer behaviour analytics allowed high-value customers to lapse undetected - the data existed but was never modelled for retention insight.**

**Improve**
Launch an immediate win-back campaign targeting At Risk customers using personalised offers based on previous purchase category. Introduce a loyalty programme for High Value and Champion segments. Front-load Q3 marketing budgets to maximise Q4 acquisition peaks.

**Control**
Monthly CLV tracking per segment. Alert when At Risk segment revenue exceeds 25% of total - triggers immediate retention intervention. Track return rate by category to catch emerging product quality issues early.

## 📋 Recommendations

1. 🔴 **Urgently address At Risk segment** - R68,755 CLV at risk of churning, win-back campaign required immediately
2. ⚠️ **Protect High Value segment** - dedicated loyalty programme to prevent CLV erosion
3. ⚠️ **Double down on Q4 acquisition** - seasonal pattern is consistent, scale campaigns and stock from October
4. 🟢 **Expand in Johannesburg, London and New York** - highest customer concentration, localised campaigns would yield strong ROI
